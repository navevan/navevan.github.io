        The Effects of Alcholism
      </h2>
      <p >
        -The impact of drinking on family life can include substantial mental health problems for other family members, such as anxiety, fear and depression.
      </br>
        -Drinking outside the home can mean less time spent at home.
      </br>
        -Heavy drinking has been strongly linked to violence between partners and to a lesser extent to violence towards others, possibly because proximity increases the opportunities for violence.
      </br>
        -Depression can be a contributing factor to alcohol consumption. This in turn creates a negtive feedback loop
      </br>
        -Comorbidity of social phobia in excessive alcohol users is quite common. Changes in personality such as increased irritability, impaired reasoning and poor judgment are said to be consequences of excessive alcohol use

      <h2 class="header">Examples of the Effects</h2>
          <h3>Family Suffering</h3>
            <p>Rick has only recently shown back up in his daughter Beth's life. After his first 20 year disappearance and his frequent trips out across multiple dimensions there is an everlooming fear that he will not be returning home.</p>

          <h3>Less Time at Home</h3>
            <p>Most of Rick's affairs are conducted outside of his home; in fact, light years away across different dimensions. Most of his affairs get him into deeper situations that require him to stay for prolonged periods of time before he has the opportunity (or is forced) back home.</p>

          <h3>Violence</h3>
          <p>Most of Rick's errands result in some kind of violence. He finds himself in places where it is necessary to fight. His acts of violence are equal parts self-defense and personal gain. His violence is largely expressed outward towards other beings but his interactions with Morty are forceful in nature prodding him to tag along on adventures.</p>

          <h3>Depression</h3>
          <p>As Rick's dark past is slowly revealed the causes of his alcoholism become more apparent. He has had an array of traumatic events continuously happen to his such as loss of loved ones and close friends, disconnection from family, and destroyed worlds. His life is a checkered pattern of disconnect, loss, and starting a new life elsewhere.</p>
